Currently working for OSX.\r\n\r\nMonitors folders with Apple's System Event API.  When a file is added to the folder Opencv is used to resize the image.  This program also uses inih(ini not invented here), to parse the config file.\r\n\r\nResize Modes\r\n- Normal resize: Resize the picture to a specific resolution.\r\n- Scale: Scale the picture with a specific scaling factor.\r\n- Border: Use a letter box to resize to a specific resolution without distortion.\r\n- Crop: Resize the image to specific resolution cropping excess to avoid distortion.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
